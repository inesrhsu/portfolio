        hand-dyed them and brought them to life with colorful crayon patterns. 
        I sewed smalled coral from fun patterned fabric. My coral are stuffed 
        soft stuffing, and are not fixed to any position. Viewers are encouraged
        to touch them and play with them lightly.
        Parts of the coral's dyed color is fading and their colorful patterns are only left on some 
        fragments of them, evoking the reality of the beautiful colors leaving 
        coral in our oceans due to coral bleaching.

        An earlier iteration of my coral was 'Breathing coral' consisting 
        of coral inflatables, with which I explored the coral having a breathing
         motion with the inflating and deflating of the coral.`,

        description:
        `I developed a program to produce star cluster evolution animations as would be 
        observed and photographed by Hubble Telescope and by James Webb Space Telescope 
        for given star cluster evolution models. The program produces images applying 
        the color filters and point spread functions of the desired telescope, for 
        each given stars' position, radius and luminosity, then stitches all images 
        into a video showing the star clusters' evolution over time. 
        
        Star clusters can have a lifespan of hundreds of millions of years, which
         is far beyond the time that Hubble Space Telescope or James Webb Space 
         Telescope are able to observe. By producing these videos we are able to 
         better understand what a star cluster evolution process would look like 
         visually if it were to be seen through a telescope. It allows for better
         visualization of the different evolution models that are being developed 
         by physicists, giving them also a visually more realistic way to present
         their star cluster evolution models.

        I presented my work and research process for producing these animations 
        with the following research poster.

        This work was made in collaboration with Professor Carl Rodriguez (University of North
         Carolina) and Dr Ugo Niccoló Di Carlo.`,

        description:
        `I was part of the team of students at Carnegie Mellon University working
         to send the Iris Lunar Rover to the Moon. This is a simulation I made 
         for the Iris lunar rover team during mission when the rover was aboard 
         Peregrine Mission One, a mission aiming to land on the Moon in January 2024. 
         Astrobotic's Peregrine lander was intended to land on the Moon, yet was 
         not able to attempt a Lunar landing due to a propulsion issue. Since a 
         lunar landing was not possible the Iris lunar rover team explored 
         alternatives. A hypothetical scenario that we explored (yet never executed) 
         included deploying the rover in space to obtain lander images of the 
         rover in space and for Iris to capture an image of the lander from space. 
         This simulation was made to visualize this hypothetical situation to the 
         Iris team and the Astrobotic team, by showing the views from both front 
         and back rover cameras, and a lander camera upon deployment, as well as 
         a general view of the rover trajectory calculated using accurate physics. 
         I produced this simulation using Unity.
         Note: the Iris rover was never deployed in space. 
         This was made in collaboration with the Iris Lunar Rover team.`,

        `In 'Year 2235' I envision that we are in the year 2235 and humanity has 
        acquired footage of what extraterrestrial life forms look like. I imagine 
        the different planetary systems these could be photographed in, most being 
        several light years away. Alien life could take any form unlike we observe 
        of life on Earth and I try to break with stereotypical image of how aliens 
        are portrayed on the TV and media. We could need different frequency ranges 
        to hear the sounds they may produce and diverse camera imaging techniques 
        to be able to observe them, as I envision in this video feed. 
        I created this video using Adobe Premiere Pro, video and mixed media.
        
        Despite my efforts to break from stereotypical media representations, 
        my imagination of alien life is still based on what I observe from reality 
        on Earth. In a different approach, I try to use AI to envision what alien
        life forms could look like. Access the project here: AI Aliens. `,

        images of what an AI thinks life forms would look like and in what type 
        of world they would live in with prompt words like “life form” and color 
        words. This was inspired by a previous project'Year 2235' in which I envision what footage captured of several alien life 
        forms would look like. I attempt to break from the media stereotypes of 
        alien life as well as preconceptions taken from life forms Earth. I wanted 
        artificial intelligence to give me some ideas, which at the same tme could 
        be more objective yet are also based on everything that we humans conceive
        life forms to look like in the internet and media.
        For each alien life form I use a picture generated by AI, modify it and 
        create a 3D model with it, then and animate it to give it life.
