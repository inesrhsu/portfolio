          About Me
        </div>
        <div className="description">
          I am a multidisciplinary artist working at the intersection of art, 
          physics and computation, whose work spans installation, sculpture, 
          physics simulation, video and animation, computational art and 3D/VR 
          work. I am Spanish and Taiwanese, and am currently based in San 
          Francisco. I have previously lived in Barcelona, Taipei, Pittsburgh 
          and love exploring new cities. 
          <br /><br />
          I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor 
          of Science and Arts in Physics and Art, and have previously interned 
          at <a href='https://www.teamlab.art'>teamLab</a> (Tokyo) as an <a href='https://open.talentio.com/r/1/c/teamlab/pages/50809'>interactive engineer</a>. 
          I am currently looking for opportunities in creative tech and am 
          eager to collaborate on installations, museum exhibitions, branding 
          initiatives and artistic experiences.

            About my work
          </div>
          <div className="description">
          I think about the large bodies in our universe like the 
          ocean and outer space and the ecosystems that could live in them. I 
          seek to bring the far away black holes, galaxies and mysteries of the 
          world closer to us. I strive to design immersive worlds, and use 
          color, patterns and motion to create playful environments. By 
          employing interactive components I encourage the audience to 
          engage with and be part of my work.
